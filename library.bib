  volume = {147},
  issn = {0021-9991},
  abstract = {We present a numerical method for solving Poisson's equation, with variable coefficients and Dirichlet boundary conditions, on two-dimensional regions. The approach uses a finite-volume discretization, which embeds the domain in a regular Cartesian grid. We treat the solution as a cell-centered quantity, even when those centers are outside the domain. Cells that contain a portion of the domain boundary use conservative differencing of second-order accurate fluxes on each cell volume. The calculation of the boundary flux ensures that the conditioning of the matrix is relatively unaffected by small cell volumes. This allows us to use multigrid iterations with a simple point relaxation strategy. We have combined this with an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) procedure. We provide evidence that the algorithm is second-order accurate on various exact solutions and compare the adaptive and nonadaptive calculations.},

  volume = {83},
  issn = {1097-0363},
  abstract = {Numerical oscillation has been an open problem for high-order numerical methods with increased local degrees of freedom (DOFs). Current strategies mainly follow the limiting projections derived originally for conventional finite volume methods and thus are not able to make full use of the sub-cell information available in the local high-order reconstructions. This paper presents a novel algorithm that introduces a nodal value-based weighted essentially non-oscillatory limiter for constrained interpolation profile/multi-moment finite volume method (CIP/MM FVM) (Ii and Xiao, J. Comput. Phys., 222 (2007), 849\textendash{}871) as an effort to pursue a better suited formulation to implement the limiting projection in schemes with local DOFs. The new scheme, CIP-CSL-WENO4 scheme, extends the CIP/MM FVM method by limiting the slope constraint in the interpolation function using the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction that makes use of the sub-cell information available from the local DOFs and is built from the point values at the solution points within three neighboring cells, thus resulting a more compact WENO stencil. The proposed WENO limiter matches well the original CIP/MM FVM, which leads to a new scheme of high accuracy, algorithmic simplicity, and computational efficiency. We present the numerical results of benchmark tests for both scalar and Euler conservation laws to manifest the fourth-order accuracy and oscillation-suppressing property of the proposed scheme.

  abstract = {In this work we propose a new formulation for high-order multi-moment constrained finite volume (MCV) method. In the one-dimensional building-block scheme, three local degrees of freedom (DOFs) are equidistantly defined within a grid cell. Two candidate polynomials for spatial reconstruction of third-order are built by adopting one additional constraint condition from the adjacent cells, i.e. the DOF at middle point of left or right neighbour. A boundary gradient switching (BGS) algorithm based on the variation-minimization principle is devised to determine the spatial reconstruction from the two candidates, so as to remove the spurious oscillations around the discontinuities. The resulted non-oscillatory MCV3-BGS scheme is of fourth-order accuracy and completely free of case-dependent ad hoc parameters. The widely used benchmark tests of one- and two-dimensional scalar and Euler hyperbolic conservation laws are solved to verify the performance of the proposed scheme in this paper. The MCV3-BGS scheme is very promising for the practical applications due to its accuracy, non-oscillatory feature and algorithmic simplicity.},

  volume = {73},
  issn = {0920-8542, 1573-0484},
  abstract = {Utilization of high-order spatial discretizations is an important trend in developing global atmospheric models. As a competitive choice, the multi-moment constrained volume (MCV) method can achieve high accuracy while maintaining similar parallel scalability to classical finite volume methods. In this work, we introduce the development of a hybrid parallel MCV-based global shallow-water model on the cubed-sphere grid. Based on a sequential code, we perform parallelization on both the process and the thread levels. To enable process-level parallelism, we first decompose the six patches of the cubed-sphere in a same 2-D partition and then employ a conflict-free pipe-flow communication scheme for overlapping the halo exchange with computations. To further exploit the heterogeneous computing capacity of an Intel Xeon Phi accelerated supercomputer, we propose a guided panel-based inner\textendash{}outer partition to distribute workload among the CPUs and the coprocessors. In addition to the above, thread-level parallelism along with various optimizations is done on both the multi-core CPU and the many-core accelerator. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the correctness of the optimized parallel code and examine its parallel performance. Test results show that both the CPU-only and the hybrid codes scale well to hundreds of processes in terms of both the strong and weak scaling. In particular, the hybrid code can achieve a speedup of 2.56\texttimes{}2.56\texttimes{}2.56\textbackslash{}times as compared to the CPU-only version. In the largest run on a 9216\texttimes{}9216\texttimes{}69216\texttimes{}9216\texttimes{}69216\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}times \textbackslash,9216\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}times \textbackslash,6 mesh (1.5 billion unknowns), the hybrid code sustains an aggregative performance of 26.5 Tflops with 486 processes (33,534 cores).},

  abstract = {A novel interface capturing scheme is proposed to compute moving interface on arbitrary hybrid unstructured grids. Different from conventional volume of fluid (VOF) schemes that require complicated geometric manipulations for interface reconstructions, the present method can be viewed as a hybrid geometric/algebraic type VOF approach, i.e. the interface is implictly retrieved from an algebraic function that effectively makes use of the geometrical information, such as normal direction and curvature of the interface. Unlike previous versions of the THINC (tangent of hyperbola interface capturing) method, the interface is represented by a quadratic surface for grid cells of arbitrary shapes in this scheme. The Gaussian quadrature is used to estimate the integration of the cell-wise multi-dimensional hyperbolic tangent reconstruction function which is then used to retrieve the interface from the volume fraction value of the target cell. The Gaussian quadrature is also used to compute the numerical fluxes from the reconstruction function. Numerical accuracy for reconstruction and flux computation can be effectively improved by increasing quadrature points. The whole solution procedure follows the finite volume method for advection transport, and is thus simple and easy to use for cells of arbitrary shapes. As verified in the benchmark tests in this paper, the presented scheme, so-called THINC/QQ (THINC method with quadratic surface representation and Gaussian quadrature) scheme, shows significantly improved geometrical fidelity of interface representation particularly for curved surface. Despite algorithmic simplicity, the solution quality of THINC/QQ is comparable to other existing VOF methods with PLIC geometrical interface reconstructions, and thus an accurate and efficient VOF scheme of great practical significance for unstructured grids.},

The numerical framework is constructed by combining VPM (volume-average/point-value multi-moment) and UMTHINC (unstructured multi-dimensional tangent of hyperbola interface capturing) schemes. To facilitate accurate and reliable simulations for interfacial multiphase flows on arbitrary and hybrid unstructured grids, we have made the following major new efforts in this work. (1) UMTHINC scheme on prismatic and pyramidal elements to facilitate computations on hybrid arbitrary unstructured grids; (2) Consistent numerical formulation for mass and momentum transports to simulate multiphase flows of large density ratio; (3) Combined FVM-FEM for accurate solution to diffusion equation; (4) Pressure-projection formulation in consistent with the balanced-force model. Integrating all these numerical techniques effectively enhances the accuracy and robustness in interface capturing and numerical solution of multiphase fluid dynamics, which results in a numerical framework of great significance for practical applications. Numerical verifications have been carried out through benchmark tests ranging from surface tension dominant flows of small scale to large scale flows with violently-changing interfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the present framework is robust with adequate accuracy for simulating multiphase flows in complex geometries.},

These two kinds of point values are solved by different numerical procedures with different Riemann solvers, and then they are used as the local degrees of freedom to generate high-order reconstructions. Numerical oscillation is effectively suppressed by a multidimensional limiting projection. The numerical dissipation is controlled by the boundary variation diminishing principle that adaptively chooses the interpolation function so as to minimize the jumps (variations) across the cell boundaries.

  abstract = {In this work, we have developed a novel numerical model for Euler equations on 3D hybrid unstructured grids including tetrahedral, hexahedral, prismatic and pyramidal elements. The model integrates the VPM (Volume integrated average and Point value based Multi-moment) spatial discretization scheme, the limiting projection with BVD (Boundary Variation Diminishing) manipulation and the Roe Riemann solver for unstructured grids. Distinguished from conventional finite volume method, both the volume-integrated average (VIA) and the point values (PV) at the cell vertices are memorized as prognostic variables and updated in time simultaneously. The VIA is computed by a finite volume formulation of flux form while the PV is point-wisely updated using the differential formulation, where the Roe solver is used to compute both conventional and differential Riemann problems. A special technique is introduced to the limiting projection that effectively suppresses both numerical oscillation and dissipation. The resulting numerical model provides remarkably improved numerical accuracy and robustness with a moderate increase in algorithmic complexity and computational cost, which makes it of practical significance for real-case applications. The numerical results of benchmark tests are presented to demonstrate the appealing solution quality of the present model in comparison with other existing methods.},

  title = {A New Shock-Capturing Scheme for Stiff Detonation Waves Problems},
  abstract = {A new approach to prevent spurious behavior caused by conventional shock-capturing schemes when solving stiff detonation waves problems is introduced in the present work. Due to smearing of discontinuous solution by the excessive numerical dissipation, conventional shock-capturing schemes have difficulties to obtain the correct location of detonation front without enough grids resolution. To overcome the excessive numerical errors around discontinuities by traditional discretized schemes used in non-reacting high speed compressible flow, we introduce a new shock-capturing scheme in which besides linear function constructed by MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Law) scheme, a step like THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) function is also employed as another candidate in the reconstruction process. The final reconstruction function is determined by boundary variation diminishing (BVD) algorithm by which numerical dissipation around discontinuities can be reduced significantly. The new resulted shock-capturing scheme is named MUSCL-THINC-BVD. One- and two-dimensional comparative numerical tests about stiff detonation waves problems are conducted with the 5th order WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme respectively, which show MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme can capture the correct position of detonation waves with improved resolution while WENO scheme, in spite of higher order, produces spurious waves. Compared with other existing methods which involves extra treatments by accepting the smeared out discontinuities profiles, the current method obtain the correct but also sharp detonation front by fundamentally reducing numerical dissipation errors from shock-capturing schemes. Thus the proposed approach is an effective but simple method to solve stiff detonation problems.},

Following the underlying idea of the volume-average/point-value multi-moment (VPM) method (Xie et al. (2014) [71]), this formulation is developed on arbitrary unstructured hybrid grids by employing the point values (PV) at both cell vertex and barycenter as the prognostic variables. The cell center value is updated via an evolution equation derived from a constraint condition of finite volume form, which ensures the rigorous numerical conservativeness. Novel numerical formulations based on the local PVs over compact stencil are proposed to enhance the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of computations on unstructured meshes of hybrid and arbitrary elements. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the present numerical model has nearly 3-order convergence rate with numerical errors much smaller than the VPM method. The numerical dissipation has been significantly suppressed, which facilitates numerical simulations of high Reynolds number flows in complex geometries.},

  abstract = {A high-order global shallow-water model on a Yin-Yang grid has been developed by using the multi-moment constrained finite-volume (MCV) method. Unlike the traditional finite-volume method, more degrees of freedom (DOFs)\textendash{}which are the values at the solution points within each mesh element\textendash{}are defined and updated in time. The time evolution equations for these point values (PVs) are derived from a set of constraint conditions in terms of the so-called multi-moment quantities, such as the PV, the volume-integrated average (VIA) and derivative. Different moments use different forms of equations which are all consistent with the shallow-water equations, among which the VIA moment is computed from a finite-volume formulation of flux form that guarantees rigorous numerical conservation. A fourth-order formulation is devised with the third-order reconstruction built over each element using the DOFs locally available. A simple and orthogonal overset grid, the Yin-Yang grid, is used to represent the spherical geometry with quasi-uniform grid spacing. The resulting global shallow-water model is attractive in algorithmic simplicity and computational efficiency. The model has been validated by widely used benchmark tests. The numerical results of the present model are competitive with most existing advanced models.},

The model is recently proposed by using the MCV (multimoment constrained finite volume) schemes with the height-based terrain following coordinate representing the topography. As discussed in our previous work, the model has some appealing features for atmospheric modeling and can be expected as a practical framework of the dynamic cores, which well balances the numerical accuracy and algorithmic complexity. The flows over the mountains of various half widths and heights were simulated with the model. The semianalytic solutions to the mountain waves through the linear theory are used to check the performance of the MCV model. It is revealed that the present model can accurately reproduce various mountain waves including those generated by the mountains with very steep inclination and is very promising for numerically simulating atmospheric flows over complex terrains.},

The new method yields solutions in the zero gas density limit which are comparable in accuracy to the method in which the gas pressure was treated as spatially constant. This improvement in accuracy allows one to compute accurate solutions on relatively coarse grids, thereby providing a speed-up over continuum or ``ghost-fluid'' methods.},

Comput., 36 (2014), pp. A2369--A2400], this paper presents MARS, a generic framework for analyzing interface tracking (IT) methods via mapping and adjusting regular semialgebraic sets. Our mathematical model for moving material regions is the metric space of bounded regular semianalytic sets, equipped with Boolean algebras and advected by homeomorphic flow maps of a nonautonomous ordinary differential equation. By examining the actions of semidiscrete and discrete flow maps upon this metric space, we pinpoint in Lemma 3.9 a fundamental difficulty in achieving an IT accuracy higher than the second order. We then propose a generic IT method by concatenating three unitary operations on the modeling space, bound its overall IT error by the sum of intuitively defined error terms, and further estimate the individual errors in terms of the time step size and a Lagrangian length scale. The analytic utility of MARS is demonstrated by applying it to analyze a variety of IT methods, including volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods and the improved PAM method (iPAM). MARS has a great potential in helping the further development of highly accurate and efficient IT methods. As an example, a cubic iPAM method inspired by MARS resolves two vortex-shear tests to machine precision on a 128-by-128 grid; it could also be vastly superior to VOF methods in terms of efficiency. Fourth-order accuracy in curvature estimation is also achieved under the framework of MARS.},

  abstract = {A generic projection maps one vector to another such that their difference is a gradient field and the projected vector does not have to be solenoidal. Via a commutator of Laplacian and the generic projection, the projected velocity is formulated as the sole evolutionary variable with the incompressibility constraint enforced by a pressure Poisson equation so that the dissipation of velocity divergence is governed by a heat equation. Different from previous projection methods, the GePUP formulation treats the time integrator as a black box. This prominent advantage is illustrated by straightforward formations of a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme and another explicit time-stepping scheme. Apart from its stability, the GePUP schemes have an optimal efficiency in that within each time step the solution is advanced by solving a sequence of linear systems with geometric multigrid. A key component of the GePUP schemes is a fourth-order discrete projection for no-penetration domains. Results of numerical tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate that the GePUP schemes are fourth-order accurate both in time and in space. To facilitate efficiency comparison to other methods, a simple formula is introduced. Systematic arguments and timing results show that the GePUP schemes could be vastly superior over lower-order methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In some cases, the GePUP schemes running on the author's personal desktop would be faster than a second-order method running on the fastest supercomputer in the world!

In the author's previous paper (Zhang, 2013 [13]) the flux sets with indices {$\pm$}1 were constructed from characteristic curves of the flow field. This work generalizes the notion of donating regions and shows that flux sets are index-by-index equivalent to the generalized donating regions for any finite integer index, provided that the two backward streaklines seeded at the two endpoints of the simple curve neither intersect nor self-intersect. All Lagrangian particles marked by their initial positions are thus classified by their fluxing indices.},

As an improved version of the polygonal area mapping (PAM) method [Q. Zhang and P. L.-F. Liu, J. Comput. Phys., 227 (2008), pp. 4063--4088], the accuracy of the iPAM method is achieved via (i) augmenting the abstract data structure of PAM to faithfully represent multiple components of material regions within a single cell, (ii) removing restrictive assumptions of PAM, (iii) adjusting the volume of represented cell material regions via polygon ear removal, and (iv) maintaining a relation \$(h\_L=r\_hh\^\{\textbackslash{}alpha\})\$ between the Eulerian grid size \$h\$ and the Lagrangian length scale that measures the distance between adjacent interface markers. Unlike volume-of-fluid methods and level-set methods, merging and separation of the tracked material is not automatically handled by the iPAM method. Instead, flexible subgrid resolutions are provided so that algorithmic behaviors of interface merging and separation can be determined from the specific physics of the problem under study. The iPAM method is a product of interdisciplinary research of different fields such as ordinary differential equations, computational geometry, and general topology. Its superior accuracy, efficiency, and versatility over previous interface tracking methods are demonstrated by a set of benchmark tests. In particular, for the vortex shear test on the \$128\textbackslash{}times 128\$ grid, the fourth-order iPAM method could be hundreds of times more efficient than state-of-the-art volume-of-fluid methods.},

The new model consists of three parts: (1) the Polygonal Area Mapping method [Q. Zhang, P.L.-F. Liu, A new interface tracking method: the polygonal area mapping method, J. Comput. Phys. 227(8) (2008) 4063-4088]; (2) a new algorithm that decomposes the interested (water) phase into a continuum zone, a buffer zone and a particle zone, based on material topology and graph theory; (3) a `passive-response' assumption, in which the air phase is assumed to respond passively to the continuum part of the water phase. The incompressible inviscid Euler equations and the equations describing the free fall of rigid bodies are used as the governing equations for the continuum-buffer zone and the particle zone, respectively, and separately. A number of examples, including water droplet impact, solitary wave propagation, and dam-break problems, are simulated for the illustration and validation of HyPAM. It is shown that HyPAM is more accurate and versatile than a continuum-based Volume-of-Fluid model. One major contribution of this work is the single-phase decomposition algorithm, useful for many other hybrid formulations. Neglecting surface tension, viscosity and particle interactions, HyPAM is currently limited to mildly-fragmented free-surface flows with high Reynolds and Weber numbers.},

  abstract = {In this follow-up of our previous work [30], the author proposes a high-order semi-implicit method for numerically solving the incompressible Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations on locally-refined periodic domains. Fourth-order finite-volume stencils are employed for spatially discretizing various operators in the context of structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Time integration adopts a fourth-order, semi-implicit, additive Runge\textendash{}Kutta method to treat the non-stiff convection term explicitly and the stiff diffusion term implicitly. The divergence-free condition is fulfilled by an approximate projection operator. Altogether, these components yield a simple algorithm for simulating incompressible viscous flows on periodic domains with fourth-order accuracies both in time and in space. Results of numerical tests show that the proposed method is superior to previous second-order methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. A major contribution of this work is the analysis of a fourth-order approximate projection operator.},

  abstract = {Volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods are widely-used for the interface tracking problem, yet rigorous analyses of them are rare. This paper presents such an analysis for incompressible flows by combining the theories of ordinary differential equations, differential geometry, and Boolean algebra. Based on the concept of donating region (DR) [Q. Zhang, SIAM Rev., 55 (2013), pp. 443--461], the author classifies the fluxing particles of a fixed control volume into four categories and derives three analytical solutions for the advection equation of the color function. One edgewise solution provides a unified view of DR-based advection algorithms for VOF methods while another cellwise solution serves as the theoretical foundation of the recent polygonal area mapping method. The well-known second-order convergence rates of streamline-based VOF advection algorithms are proved rigorously. Potential deterioration of this second-order convergence is also discussed for several subtle issues such as exact mass conservation and interface continuity. A new advection algorithm via donating region approximation by cubic splines (DRACS) is proposed and demonstrated to have fourth-order convergence rates both in 1-norm and max-norm.},

  volume = {111},
  issn = {0027-8424, 1091-6490},
  abstract = {A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to understand how biologically salient motor behaviors emerge from properties of the underlying neural circuits. Crayfish, krill, prawns, lobsters, and other long-tailed crustaceans swim by rhythmically moving limbs called swimmerets. Over the entire biological range of animal size and paddling frequency, movements of adjacent swimmerets maintain an approximate quarter-period phase difference with the more posterior limbs leading the cycle. We use a computational fluid dynamics model to show that this frequency-invariant stroke pattern is the most effective and mechanically efficient paddling rhythm across the full range of biologically relevant Reynolds numbers in crustacean swimming. We then show that the organization of the neural circuit underlying swimmeret coordination provides a robust mechanism for generating this stroke pattern. Specifically, the wave-like limb coordination emerges robustly from a combination of the half-center structure of the local central pattern generating circuits (CPGs) that drive the movements of each limb, the asymmetric network topology of the connections between local CPGs, and the phase response properties of the local CPGs, which we measure experimentally. Thus, the crustacean swimmeret system serves as a concrete example in which the architecture of a neural circuit leads to optimal behavior in a robust manner. Furthermore, we consider all possible connection topologies between local CPGs and show that the natural connectivity pattern generates the biomechanically optimal stroke pattern most robustly. Given the high metabolic cost of crustacean swimming, our results suggest that natural selection has pushed the swimmeret neural circuit toward a connection topology that produces optimal behavior.},

This method represents material areas explicitly as piecewise polygons, traces characteristic points on polygon boundaries along pathlines and calculates new material areas inside interface cells via polygon-clippings in a discrete manner. The new method has very little spatial numerical diffusion and tracks the interface singularities naturally and accurately. In addition to high accuracy, the PAM method can be directly used on either a structured rectangular mesh or an unstructured mesh without any modifications. The mass conservation is enforced by heuristic algorithms adjusting the volume of material polygons. The results from a set of widely used benchmark tests show that the PAM method is superior to existing volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods.},

  abstract = {The dynamic processes of bore propagation over a uniform slope are studied numerically using a 2-D Reynolds Averaged Navier\textendash{}Stokes (RANS) solver, coupled to a non-linear k-{$\epsilon$} turbulence closure and a volume of fluid (VOF) method. The dam-break mechanism is used to generate bores in a constant depth region. Present numerical results for the ensemble-averaged flow field are compared with existing experimental data as well as theoretical and numerical results based on non-linear shallow water (NSW) equations. Reasonable agreement between the present numerical solutions and experimental data is observed. Using the numerical results, small-scale bore behaviors and flow features, such as the bore collapse process near the still-water shoreline, the `mini-collapse' during the runup phase and the `back-wash bore' in the down-rush phase, are described. In the case of a strong bore, the evolution of the averaged turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) over the swash zone consists of two phases: in the region near the still-water shoreline, the production and the dissipation of TKE are roughly in balance; in the region farther landwards of the still-water shoreline, the TKE decay rate is very close to that of homogeneous grid turbulence. On the other hand, in the case of a weak bore, the bore collapse generated turbulence is confined near the bottom boundary layer and the TKE decays at a much slower rate.},

This technique uses a partitioning procedure to detect disconnected regions of material in the advective preimage of a cell (indicative of a filament) and makes use of the existing functionality of the Multimaterial Moment-of-Fluid interface reconstruction method to accurately capture the under-resolved feature, while exactly conserving volume. An algorithm for Adaptive Mesh Refinement in the presence of filaments is developed so that refinement is introduced only near the tips of filaments and where the Moment-of-Fluid reconstruction error is still large. Comparison to the standard Moment-of-Fluid method is made. It is demonstrated that using filament capturing at a given resolution yields gains in accuracy comparable to introducing an additional level of mesh refinement at significantly lower cost.},

The advection terms are solved using a directionally split cell integrated semi-Lagrangian algorithm, and the projection method is used to evaluate the pressure gradient force term. The underlying computational grid is a dynamic block-structured adaptive grid. The new method is applied to multiphase problems illustrating contact-line dynamics, triple junctions, and encapsulation in order to demonstrate its capabilities. Examples are given in two-dimensional, three-dimensional axisymmetric (R\textendash{}Z), and three-dimensional (X\textendash{}Y\textendash{}Z) coordinate systems.

  abstract = {A coupled level set and moment of fluid method (CLSMOF) is described for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flows. The local piecewise linear interface reconstruction (the CLSMOF reconstruction) uses information from the level set function, volume of fluid function, and reference centroid, in order to produce a slope and an intercept for the local reconstruction. The level set function is coupled to the volume-of-fluid function and reference centroid by being maintained as the signed distance to the CLSMOF piecewise linear reconstructed interface.The nonlinear terms in the momentum equations are solved using the sharp interface approach recently developed by Raessi and Pitsch (Annual Research Brief, 2009). We have modified the algorithm of Raessi and Pitsch from a staggered grid method to a collocated grid method and we combine their treatment for the nonlinear terms with the variable density, collocated, pressure projection algorithm developed by Kwatra et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 228:4146\textendash{}4161, 2009). A collocated grid method makes it convenient for using block structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) grids. Many 2D and 3D numerical simulations of bubbles, jets, drops, and waves on a block structured adaptive grid are presented in order to demonstrate the capabilities of our new method.},

  abstract = {Cartesian-grid methods with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) are ideally suited for simulating the breaking of waves, the formation of spray, and the entrainment of air around ships. As a result of the cartesian-grid formulation, minimal input is required to describe the ships geometry. A surface panelization of the ship hull is used as input to automatically generate a three-dimensional model. No three-dimensional gridding is required. The AMR portion of the numerical algorithm automatically clusters grid points near the ship in regions where wave breaking, spray formation, and air entrainment occur. Away from the ship, where the flow is less turbulent, the mesh is coarser. The numerical computations are implemented using parallel algorithms. Together, the ease of input and usage, the ability to resolve complex free-surface phenomena, and the speed of the numerical algorithms provide a robust capability for simulating the free-surface disturbances near a ship. Here, numerical predictions, with and without AMR, are compared to experimental measurements of ships moving with constant forward speed, including a vertical strut, the DDG 5415, and a wedge-like geometry.},

  abstract = {We present a coupled level set/volume-of-fluid method for computing growth and collapse of vapor bubbles. The liquid is assumed incompressible and the vapor is assumed to have constant pressure in space. Second order algorithms are used for finding ``mass conserving'' extension velocities, for discretizing the local interfacial curvature and also for the discretization of the cell-centered projection step. Convergence studies are given that demonstrate this second order accuracy. Examples are provided that apply to cavitating bubbles.},

Wave modelling can be viewed as an extension of wave theory, a mature and widely published field, applied to practical engineering through the use of computer tools. Information about the various wave models which have been developed is often widely scattered in the literature, and consequently this is one of the first books devoted to wave models and their applications.  At the core of the book is an introduction to various types of wave models. For each model, the theoretical assumptions, the application range, and the advantages and limitations are elaborated. The combined use of different wave models from large-scale to local-scale is highlighted with a detailed discussion of the application and matching of boundary conditions. At the same time the book provides a grounding in hydrodynamics, wave theory, and numerical methods which underlie wave modelling. It presents the theoretical background and also shows how to use these models for achieving different engineering tasks, illustrated and reinforced with case study examples.},

  abstract = {In Sussman, Smereka, and Osher [J. Comp. Phys., 94 (1994), pp. 146--159], a numerical scheme was presented for computing incompressible air--water flows using the level set method. Crucial to the above method was a new iteration method for maintaining the level set function as the signed distance from the zero level set. In this paper we implement a "constraint" along with higher order difference schemes in order to make the iteration method more accurate and efficient. Accuracy is measured in terms of the new computed signed distance function and the original level set function having the same zero level set. We apply our redistancing scheme to incompressible flows with noticeably better resolved results at reduced cost. We validate our results with experiment and theory. We show that our "distance level set scheme" with the added constraint competes well with available interface tracking schemes for basic advection of an interface. We perform basic accuracy checks and more stringent tests involving complicated interfacial structures. As with all level set schemes, our method is easy to implement.},

In the level set approach, the free surface is represented as the zero level set of a smooth function; this has the effect of replacing the advection of density, which has steep gradients at the free surface, with the advection of the level set function, which is smooth. In addition, the free surface can merge or break up with no special treatment. We maintain the level set function as the signed distance from the free surface in order to accurately compute flows with high density ratios and stiff surface tension effects. In this work, we couple the level set scheme to an adaptive projection method for the incompressible Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations, in order to achieve higher resolution of the free surface with a minimum of additional expense. We present two-dimensional axisymmetric and fully three-dimensional results of air bubble and water drop computations.},

The long coastline of China contains abundant tidal energy, but not all coastal area worth exploiting. It is generally considered that a mean spring peak tidal current of at least 2 m/s is required for tidal current power exploitation. Thus we choose to evaluate the tidal kinetic energy of East China Sea coastal area where 95 waterways contained, accounting for 78.6\% of China's tidal kinetic energy. Considering the interaction between the Yangtze Estuary and Hangzhou Bay, a high resolution model with unstructured 3D grid system FVCOM (finite volume coastal ocean model) has been applied to simulate tidal motion in the Yangtze Estuary-Hangzhou Bay. The numerical results of the refined model has been validated with: (a) measured tidal currents data after harmonic analysis; (b) measured tide level hydrograph and velocity which were observed by China's coastal physical oceanography and marine meteorological special investigation on the East China Sea during August, 2014. It is also noticed that the area where power density larger than 10 kW/m2 are mainly distributed over North Port of Yangtze Estuary and north of Hangzhou Bay, and the maximal value of the possible maximum velocity of the tidal current reaches 3.0-3.5 m/s at Hangzhou Bay.},

A high-order finite difference method is employed as the flow solver, where the CIP method is used to discretize the convective term. The tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing/slope weighting (THINC/SW) is adopted to capture the free surface/interface, and an immersed boundary method is applied to simulate the motion of bodies. The present numerical model involving symmetric water entry is verified in comparison with the previous numerical and experimental results in the literature. The results of the asymmetric water entry are provided in terms of the penetration depth, velocity, pile-up coefficients, impact force of wedges, and velocity and pressure distributions of fluid. Considerable attention is paid into the effects of deadrise and inclination angles. It is found that the presence of the inclination angle significantly influences both the velocity and pressure field, and further regulates the penetration depth, velocity, pile-up coefficients, and impact force on the wedge. Specifically, wedges entering into the water with small deadrise angles are found to be more sensitive to the inclination angle than those with large deadrise angle.},

The flume is employed to simulate the transformation of water waves with different steepness and wavelength. The calculation results of the free-surface elevation and the corresponding amplitude wave spectrum are compared with the linear wave solutions and the analytical solutions. The result of the investigations is that short waves agree well with the linear solutions, whereas the long waves with limited Ursell numbers are consistent with the analytical solutions. Physical experiments are conducted in a wave flume to verify the numerical scheme. Good agreement between the experimental and the numerical results is obtained. The time\textendash{}frequency information of waves is also investigated based on the wavelet transform. The numerical results show that short waves with smaller Benjamin\textendash{}Feir index (BFI) are more stable than long waves with larger BFI in finite wave depth.},

Due to mismatch between linear input wavemaker motion and the kinematics of fully nonlinear waves, direct numerical simulations of progressive waves, generated by a sinusoidally moving wavemaker, are prone to high-frequency wave instability unless the flow is given sufficient time to adjust. A time ramp is superimposed on wavemaker motion at the start, which allows nonlinear free-surface simulations to be initialized with linear input. Three time ramp functions are introduced to check the difference of the time ramp. The time\textendash{}frequency information of waves is also investigated by means of wavelet analysis. Numerical results show that the difference of the time ramp function is minor and the time ramp scheme is effective in stabilizing wave instability at the start of the simulation in a wave flume.},

This numerical model is improved by 1) introducing Wen's frequency spectrum and Mitsuyasu's directional function, which are more suitable to the coastal area of China; 2) considering energy dissipation caused by bottom friction, which ensures more accurate results for large-scale and shallow water areas; 3) taking into account a non-linear dispersion relation. Predictions using the extended wave model are carried out to study the feasibility of constructing the Ai Hua yacht port in Qingdao, China, with a comparison between two port layouts in design. Wave fields inside the port for different incident wave directions, water levels and return periods are simulated, and then two kinds of parameters are calculated to evaluate the wave conditions for the two layouts. Analyses show that Layout I is better than Layout II. Calculation results also show that the harbor will be calm for different wave directions under the design water level. On the contrary, the wave conditions do not wholly meet the requirements of a yacht port for ship berthing under the extreme water level. For safety consideration, the elevation of the breakwater might need to be properly increased to prevent wave overtopping under such water level. The extended numerical simulation model may provide an effective approach to computing wave heights in a harbor.},

  abstract = {The oscillating water column (OWC) device is in a leading position for wave power extraction but has not achieved fully commercial at the current stage. In addition to enhancing the OWC performance, installing OWCs on floating breakwaters, which owns the merits of both cost-sharing and offshore power supply, is a practicality with high economic viability. In this study, a series of wave-flume experiments were conducted in regular waves to examine the wave power extraction of a floating box-type breakwater with dual pneumatic chambers. The flow characteristics of the orifices used to simulate the PTOs was pre-calibrated through another series of experiments, so the power extraction in this study can be obtained with only the pressure measurement. The effects of wave period, chamber draft, water depth and arrangement of chambers on the power extraction were examined. Our experimental results showed that the power extraction was mainly due to the water column oscillation inside the chamber, and differentiation in the designed natural periods of dual chambers could widen the efficiency bandwidth of power extraction. The front chamber always played the main role in power extraction and its natural period should be designed against the dominating period of the wave spectrum; in contrast, the power extraction of the rear chamber was only a supplement and its natural period should be designed against longer waves which were more easily transmitted, thus a PTO of small power capacity maybe more realistic. It was also worth noting that the water column oscillation was more dependent on the wave period rather than controlled by the wave scattering under different water depths.},

The Poisson equation of pressure is solved by the incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient method. Collapse of a water column is calculated using MPS. The effect of parameters in the models is investigated in test calculations. Good agreement with an experiment is obtained even if fragmentation and coalescence of the fluid take place.},

To assess the developed algorithm and its versatility, a selection of test problems are examined, i.e. the square wave propagation, the Zalesak's rigid body rotation, dam breaking problem with and without obstacles, wave sloshing in an excited wave tank and interaction between extreme waves and a floating body. Excellent agreements are obtained when numerical results are compared with available analytical, experimental, and other numerical results.

  abstract = {A Constrained Interpolation Profile (CIP)-based model is developed to predict the mooring force of a two-dimensional floating oil storage tank under wave conditions, which is validated against to a newly performed experiment. In the experiment, a box-shaped floating oil storage apparatus is used. Computations are performed by an improved CIP-based Cartesian grid model, in which the THINC/SW scheme (THINC: tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing; SW: Slope Weighting), is used for interface capturing. A multiphase flow solver is adopted to treat the water-air-body interactions. The Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is implemented to treat the body surface. Main attention is paid to the sum force of mooring line and velocity field around the body. It is found that the sum force of the mooring line increases with increasing wave amplitude. The body suffers from water wave impact and large body motions occur near the free surface. The vortex occurs near the sharp edge, i.e., the sharp bottom corners of the floating oil storage tank and the vortex shedding can be captured by the present numerical model. The present model could be further improved by including turbulence model which is currently under development. Comparison between the computational mooring forces and the measured mooring forces is presented with a reasonable agreement. The developed numerical model can predict the mooring line forces very well.},

The accuracy and robustness of these models have improved markedly in the past twenty years, so that they are now applicable to complex, three-dimensional configurations of great theoretical and practical interest. In this review I attempt to summarize the most significant recent developments in Eulerian surface tension models, with an emphasis on well-balancing, curvature estimation, stability and implicit time-stepping as well as test cases and applications. The advantages and limitations of various models are discussed, with a focus on common features rather than differences. Several avenues for further progress are suggested.},

  abstract = {Finite-difference schemes for the conservation laws of ideal compressible flow are constructed on the basis of upstream-centered convective schemes, Fromm's second-order scheme in particular. The upstream centering generates a number of higher-order terms, making the schemes quite complex. In consequence, they seem to compare unfavorably with central-difference schemes as regards computational efficiency. Previously derived upstream-centered terms that prevent numerical oscillations in Fromm's scheme partly lose their effect when included in a version of the scheme for compressible flow. Apparently, the finite-difference approach is of little avail in formulating upstream schemes for compressible flow. It is anticipated that Godunov's approach, involving more of the physics in the conservation laws, will lead to more attractive schemes.},

ENO and WENO schemes are high order accurate finite difference schemes designed for problems with piecewise smooth solutions containing discontinuities. The key idea lies at the approximation level, where a nonlinear adaptive procedure is used to automatically choose the locally smoothest stencil, hence avoiding crossing discontinuities in the interpolation procedure as much as possible. ENO and WENO schemes have been quite successful in applications, especially for problems containing both shocks and complicated smooth solution structures, such as compressible turbulence simulations and aeroacoustics. These lecture notes are basically self-contained. It is our hope that with these notes and with the help of the quoted references, the reader can understand the algorithms and code them up for applications.},

The weights of the basic functions that approximate the initial values in a mesh may be determined by finite differencing, but the most accurate schemes are obtained by least-squares fitting. In the latter schemes, the weights of the basic functions must be regarded as independent state quantities and must be stored separately.

The WENO scheme follows the same idea of an essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) scheme with an advantage of achieving higher-order accuracy with fewer computations. Both ENO and WENO can be easily applied to two and three spatial dimensions by evaluating the fluxes dimension-by-dimension. Details of the WENO scheme as well as the construction of a suitable eigen-system, which can properly decompose various families of MHD waves and handle the degenerate situations, are presented. Numerical results are shown to perform well for the one-dimensional Brio\textendash{}Wu Riemann problems, the two-dimensional Kelvin\textendash{}Helmholtz instability problems, and the two-dimensional Orszag\textendash{}Tang MHD vortex system. They also demonstrate the importance of maintaining the divergence free condition for the magnetic field in achieving numerical stability. The tests also show the advantages of using the higher-order scheme. The new 5th-order WENO MHD code can attain an accuracy comparable with that of the second-order schemes with many fewer grid points.},

The motion of the interface is tracked by the solution of a scalar transport equation for a phase-indicator field that is discontinuous at the interface and uniform elsewhere; no explicit interface reconstruction, which is perceived to be difficult to implement on unstructured meshes, is needed. The novelty of the method lies in the adaptive combination of high resolution discretisation schemes which ensure the preservation of the sharpness and shape of the interface while retaining boundedness of the field. The special implicit implementation presented herein makes it applicable to unstructured meshes and an extension to such grids is presented. The method is capable of handling interface rupture and coalescence. The paper outlines the methodology of CICSAM and its validation against academic test cases used to verify its accuracy.},

The bottom irregularities, which in many practical cases strongly affect the dynamics and the continuity, are accounted for statistically. Assuming hydrostatic approximation, the three-dimensional Reynolds equations are suitably averaged over a representative elementary area and then integrated over the depth. The resulting subgrid model for ground irregularities is tested by resolving two sample problems. The first concerns the wetting and drying of tidal flats; the second deals with overland flow on an irregular plane surface. Numerical simulations show that the proposed equations are a useful tool for modelers who have to cope with partially dry domains.},

The model integrates the concepts of Defina's (2000) subgrid model and the ideas of Volp et al. (2013) on treatment of the feedback of fine grid effects into coarse grid calculations. A pre-storage method is proposed to pre-calculate coarse cell-wise integrated variables associated with high resolution bathymetry data in order to further improve the model efficiency. Model validations are conducted in an idealized channel-flat system as well as a meso-tidal salt marsh. Results show that the subgrid model is capable of obtaining results which are comparable to those from the full grid model running directly on the high-resolution grid, but the computational cost can be orders of magnitude smaller than the full grid model due to the reduction in the number of computational cells and the increase in time-step size. Flows over subgrid micro-topography features like narrow channels and creeks can also be modeled, which is crucial for simulating flow routing in marsh networks. With the increasing availability of high-resolution coastal topographic data and the need for high-resolution modeling, the model is promising for applications to largescale salt marsh modeling.},

These input data along with model outputs of spatially variable wave heights and characteristic period were aggregated into supervised learning training and test data sets, which were supplied to machine learning models. These machine learning models replicated wave heights from the physics-based model with a root-mean-squared error of 9 cm and correctly identify over 90\% of the characteristic periods for the test-data sets.

  abstract = {In this paper, we outline two improvements to the fast sweeping method to improve the speed of the method in general and more specifically in cases where the speed is changing rapidly. The conventional wisdom is that fast sweeping works best when the speed changes slowly, and fast marching is the algorithm of choice when the speed changes rapidly. The goal here is to achieve run times for the fast sweeping method that are at least as fast, or faster, than competitive methods, e.g. fast marching, in the case where the speed is changing rapidly. The first improvement, which we call the locking method, dynamically keeps track of grid points that have either already had the solution successfully calculated at that grid point or for which the solution cannot be successfully calculated during the current iteration. These locked points can quickly be skipped over during the fast sweeping iterations, avoiding many time-consuming calculations. The second improvement, which we call the two queue method, keeps all of the unlocked points in a data structure so that the locked points no longer need to be visited at all. Unfortunately, it is not possible to insert new points into the data structure while maintaining the fast sweeping ordering without at least occasionally sorting. Instead, we segregate the grid points into those with small predicted solutions and those with large predicted solutions using two queues. We give two ways of performing this segregation. This method is a label correcting (iterative) method like the fast sweeping method, but it tends to operate near the front like the fast marching method. It is reminiscent of the threshold method for finding the shortest path on a network, [F. Glover, D. Klingman, and N. Phillips, Oper. Res., 33 (1985), pp. 65\textendash{}73]. We demonstrate the numerical efficiency of the improved methods on a number of examples.},

The data is interpolated on a single box of the mesh using a bicubic approximation. The distance to the front is then calculated by using a variant of Newton's method to solve both the level curve equation and the orthogonality condition for the nearest point to a given node. The result is a second order approximation of the distance to the interface which can then be used to produce second order accurate initial conditions for the fast marching method and a third order fast marching method.},

Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

  abstract = {We describe multi-material (more than two materials) interface reconstruction methods for 3D meshes of generalized polyhedra. The basic information used in interface reconstruction is the volume fraction of each material in mixed cells, that is, those containing multiple materials. All methods subdivide a mixed cell into a set of pure non-overlapping sub-cells, each containing just one material that have the reference volume fraction. We describe three methods. The first two methods represent an extension of standard piece-wise linear interface construction (PLIC) methods to 3D and use information only about volume fractions. The first method is first-order accurate and is based on the discrete gradient of the volume fraction as an estimate of the normal to the interface. The second method is planarity-preserving (second-order accurate) and is an extension to 3D of the least squares volume-of-fluid interface reconstruction algorithm (LVIRA, see [E. Puckett, A volume-of-fluid interface tracking algorithm with applications to computing shock wave refraction, in: H. Dwyer (Ed.), Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Computational Fluid Dynamics, 1991, pp. 933\textendash{}938; J.E. Pilliod, E.G. Puckett, Second-order accurate volume-of-fluid algorithms for tracking material interfaces, Journal of Computational Physics 199 (2004) 465\textendash{}502] for the 2D case). The third method is an extension to 3D of the so-called moment-of-fluid (MoF) method [V. Dyadechko, M. Shashkov, Moment-of-fluid interface reconstruction, Tech. Rep. LA-UR-05-7571, Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2005. Also available as http://cnls.lanl.gov/\textasciitilde{}shashkov/; V. Dyadechko, M.

Also available as http://cnls.lanl.gov/\textasciitilde{}shashkov/]. The MoF method is also second-order accurate. This method uses information not only about volume fractions but also about the position of the centroids of each material. In contrast to standard PLIC methods, the MoF method uses only information from the cell where reconstruction is performed; no information from neighboring cells is needed. Also, the MoF method provides automatic ordering of the materials during interface reconstruction. Optimal ordering is based on comparing the positions of the reference centroids and actual centroids of the reconstructed pure sub-cells. The performance of the methods is demonstrated with numerical examples.},

  abstract = {The moment-of-fluid (MOF) method is a new volume-tracking method that accurately treats evolving material interfaces. The MOF method uses moment data, namely the material volume fraction, as well as the centroid, for a more accurate representation of the material configuration, interfaces and concomitant volume advection. In contrast, the volume-of-fluid method uses only volume fraction data for interface reconstruction and advection. Based on the moment data for each material, the material interfaces are reconstructed with second-order spatial accuracy in a strictly conservative manner. The MOF method is coupled with a stabilized finite element incompressible Navier\textendash{}Stokes solver for two materials. The effectiveness of the MOF method is demonstrated with a free-surface dam-break and a two-material Rayleigh\textendash{}Taylor problem. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A novel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) strategy based on the moment-of-fluid (MOF) method for volume-tracking of evolving interfaces is presented. Moment-of-fluid method is a new interface reconstruction and volume advection method using volume fractions as well as material centroids. The mesh refinement criterion is based on the deviation of the actual centroid obtained by interface reconstruction from the reference centroid given by moment advection process. The centroid error indicator detects not only high curvature regions but also regions with complicated subcell structures like filaments. A new Lagrange + remap scheme is presented for advecting moments, which includes Lagrangian backtracking, polygon intersection-based remapping and forward tracking to define the material centroid. The effectiveness and efficiency of AMR-MOF method is demonstrated with classical test problems, such as Zalesak's disk and reversible vortex problem. The comparison with previously published results for these problems shows the superior accuracy of the AMR-MOF method over other methods. In addition, two new test cases with severe deformation rates are introduced, namely droplet deformation and S-shape deformation problems, for further demonstration of the capabilities of the AMR-MOF method.},

We propose a design criteria for a volume-of-fluid interface reconstruction algorithm to be second-order accurate. Namely, that it reproduce lines in two space dimensions or planes in three space dimensions exactly. We also introduce a second-order, unsplit, volume-of-fluid advection algorithm that is based on a second-order, finite difference method for scalar conservation laws due to Bell, Dawson and Shubin. We test this advection algorithm by modeling several different interface shapes propagating in two simple incompressible flows and compare the results with the standard second-order, operator-split advection algorithm. Although both methods are second-order accurate when the interface is smooth, we find that the unsplit algorithm exhibits noticeably better resolution in regions where the interface has discontinuous derivatives, such as at corners.},

In order to show the potential of the code in different scenarios related to atomization, preliminary results are shown in relation with the study of the two-dimensional and 3D temporal and spatial problem, the influence of the injector and the vortex generated inside the chamber, and the effect of swirling at high Reynolds numbers.},

  title = {Direct {{Simulations}} of {{Wind}}-{{Driven Breaking Ocean Waves}} with {{Data Assimilation}}},
  abstract = {A formulation is developed to assimilate ocean-wave data into the Numerical Flow Analysis (NFA) code. NFA is a Cartesian-based implicit LES code with Volume of Fluid (VOF) interface capturing. The sequential assimilation of data into NFA permits detailed analysis of ocean-wave physics with higher bandwidths than is possible using either other formulations, such as HighOrder Spectral (HOS) methods, or field measurements. A framework is provided for assimilating the wavy and vortical portions of the flow. Nudging is used to assimilate wave data at low wavenumbers, and the wave data at high wavenumbers form naturally through nonlinear interactions, wave breaking, and wind forcing. Similarly, the vertical profiles of the mean vortical flow in the wind and the wind drift are nudged, and the turbulent fluctuations are allowed to form naturally. As a demonstration, the results of a HOS of a JONSWAP wave spectrum are assimilated to study short-crested seas in equilibrium with the wind. Log profiles are assimilated for the mean wind and the mean wind drift. The results of the data assimilations are (1) Windrows form under the action of breaking waves and the formation of swirling jets; (2) The crosswind and cross drift meander; (3) Swirling jets are organized into Langmuir cells in the upper oceanic boundary layer; (4) Swirling jets are organized into wind streaks in the lower atmospheric boundary layer; (5) Wave growth is very dynamic especially for breaking waves; (6) The effects of the turbulent fluctuations in the upper ocean on wave growth need to be considered together with the turbulent fluctuations in the lower atmosphere; (7) Extreme events are most likely when waves are not in equilibrium; and (8) Vertical mixing is order 5 cm/s in the upper 15 meters of the ocean and 0.4 m/s in the lower 50 meters of the atmosphere.},

Especially in grid-based fluid simulation, because of iterative computation, the projection step is much more time-consuming than other steps. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven projection method using an artificial neural network to avoid iterative computation. Once the grid resolution is decided, our data-driven method could obtain projection results in relatively constant time per grid cell, which is independent of scene complexity. Experimental results demonstrated that our data-driven method drastically speeded up the computation in the projection step. With the growth of grid resolution, the speed-up would increase strikingly. In addition, our method is still applicable in different fluid scenes with some alterations, when computational cost is more important than physical accuracy.

Key for arriving at a feasible algorithm is a technique for dimensionality reduction based on convolutional neural networks, as well as a special architecture for temporal prediction. We demonstrate that dense 3D+time functions of physics system can be predicted with neural networks, and we arrive at a neural-network based simulation algorithm with significant practical speed-ups. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method with a series of complex liquid simulations, and with a set of single-phase buoyancy simulations. With a set of trained networks, our method is more than two orders of magnitudes faster than a traditional pressure solver.

In addition, we demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and compression of fluid simulation data.

  abstract = {Data generated by direct numerical simulations (DNS) of bubbly up-flow in a periodic vertical channel is used to generate closure relationships for a simplified two-fluid model for the average flow. Nearly spherical bubbles, initially placed in a fully developed parabolic flow, are driven relatively quickly to the walls, where they increase drag and slowly reduce the flow rate. Once the flow rate has been decreased enough, some of the bubbles move back into the channel interior and the void fraction there approaches the value needed to balance the weight of the mixture and the imposed pressure gradient. A database is generated by averaging the DNS results over planes parallel to the walls, and a Model Averaging Neural Network (MANN) is used to find the relationships between unknown closure terms in a simple model equations for the average flow and the resolved variables. The closure relations are then tested, by following the evolution of different initial conditions, and it is found that the model predictions are in reasonably good agreement with DNS results.},

This algorithm, which was motivated by statistical physics, is now interpreted as gradient descent on a modified loss function.

Experimental results on modern, high-dimensional neural networks demonstrate that the algorithm converges faster than the benchmark stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Well-established PDE regularity results allow us to analyze the geometry of the relaxed energy landscape, confirming empirical evidence. Stochastic homogenization theory allows us to better understand the convergence of the algorithm. A stochastic control interpretation is used to prove that a modified algorithm converges faster than SGD in expectation.},

  abstract = {Background: Growing evidence suggests that lycopene has significant in vitro antioxidant potential. Lycopene has rarely been tested in prospective studies for its role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.
Objective: We examined the association between plasma lycopene and the risk of CVD in middle-aged and elderly women. Design: A prospective, nested, case-control study was conducted in 39 876 women initially free of CVD and cancer in the Women's Health Study. Baseline blood samples were collected from 28 345 (71\%) of the women. During a mean of 4.8 y of follow-up, we identified 483 CVD cases and 483 control subjects matched by age, smoking status, and follow-up time. Plasma lycopene, other carotenoids, retinol, and total cholesterol were measured.
Results: In analyses matched for age and smoking, with adjustment for plasma cholesterol, the relative risks (RRs) and 95\% CIs of CVD in increasing quartiles of plasma lycopene were 1.00 (referent), 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.55, 1.11), 0.56 (0.39, 0.82), and 0.62 (0.43, 0.90). In multivariate models, the RRs were 1.00 (referent), 0.94 (0.60, 1.49), 0.62 (0.39, 1.00), and 0.67 (0.41, 1.11); those in the upper compared with the lower half of plasma lycopene had an RR of 0.66 (0.47, 0.95). For CVD, exclusive of angina, women in the upper 3 quartiles had a significant multivariate 50\% risk reduction compared with those in the lowest quartile. The stepwise addition of individual plasma carotenoids did not affect the RRs.
Conclusions: Higher plasma lycopene concentrations are associated with a lower risk of CVD in women. These findings require confirmation in other cohorts, and the determinants of plasma lycopene concentrations need to be better understood. Am J Clin Nutr 2004;79:47\textendash{}53.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a numerical wave flume with full functions of wave generation and absorption is proposed under the framework of Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH). In contrast to the conventional SPH numerical wave flumes using wave paddles and sponge layers, the wave generation and absorption in this paper are implemented using non-reflective open boundary conditions, which are capable of generating multiple types of waves, including solitary waves, linear and second-order regular waves. Passive and active wave absorption are available for transmitting incident waves and preventing secondary reflections. Steady or unsteady flows can also be defined during wave generation and absorption to set up numerical waveflow flumes. The results on a series of validation cases indicate that this SPH numerical wave flume not only performs satisfactorily in conventional wave generation and absorption and nonlinear wave-structure interaction simulations but also has the following three advantages: 1) It avoids using the sponge layers to shorten the flumes, which improves the efficiency; 2) it keeps the mean water level steady and prevents water level shifting; and 3) it implements steady/unsteady flow and wave-flow interactions to model a wider range of hydrodynamic problems.},

Conflict management is an open issue in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. There is no good practice that can be generally accepted until the presence of generalized evidence theory (GET). GET addresses conflict management in an open world, where the frame of discernment (FOD) is incomplete since uncertainty and lacking knowledge. With the in-depth study, however, the original generalized combination rule (GCR) still has its issue. As an example, based on the original GCR, the system judges whether the FOD is complete or not even though the GBPAs clearly indicate that the proposition is outside of FOD. In this paper, we proposed a modified generalized combination rule (mGCR) in the framework of GET. The mGCR satisfies all properties of GCR in GET, illustrating and modeling the real world more reasonably than the original. Numerical examples demonstrate that mGCR combines GBPAs effectively and has more distinct geometric and physical meaning than the original GCR. Several experiments using real data sets are presented at the end of this paper to evaluate the effectiveness of mGCR.},

In comparison with classical evidence theory, GET addresses conflict management in an open world, where the frame of discernment is incomplete because of uncertainty and incomplete knowledge. Within the presented GET, we define a novel concept called generalized basic probability assignment (GBPA) to model uncertain information, and provide a generalized combination rule (GCR) for the combination of GBPAs, and build a generalized conflict model to measure conflict among evidences. Conflicting evidence can be effectively handled using the GET framework.

To achieve the desired behavior, a continuous quasi-Newton optimization solves for appropriate "wind" forces to be applied to the underlying velocity field throughout the simulation. The cornerstone of our approach is a method to efficiently compute exact derivatives through the steps of a fluid simulation. We formulate an objective function corresponding to how well a simulation matches the user's keyframes, and use the derivatives to solve for force parameters that minimize this function. For animations with several keyframes, we present a novel multiple-shooting approach. By splitting large problems into smaller overlapping subproblems, we greatly speed up the optimization process while avoiding certain local minima.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of optimization techniques based on control theory for airfoil and wing design. The theory is applied to a system defined by the partial differential equations of the flow, with control by the boundary as a free surface. The Frechet derivative of the cost function is determined via the solution of an adjoint partial differential equation, and the boundary shape is then modified in a direction of descent. This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached. Each design cycle requires the numerical solution of both the flow and the adjoint equations, leading t o a computational cost roughly equal t o the cost of two flow solutions. The cost is kept low by using multigrid techniques, which yield a sufficiently accurate solution in about 15 iterations. Satisfactory designs are usually obtained with 10-20 design cycles.},

  abstract = {ConclusionThe purpose of the last three sections is to demonstrate by representative examples that control theory can be used to formulate computationally feasible procedures for aerodynamic design. The cost of each iteration is of the same order as two flow solutions, since the adjoint equation is of comparable complexity to the flow equation, and the remaining auxiliary equations could be solved quite inexpensively. Provided, therefore, that one can afford the cost of a moderate number of flow solutions, procedures of this type can be used to derive improved designs. The approach is quite general, not limited to particular choices of the coordinate transformation or cost function, which might in fact contain measures of other criteria of performance such as lift and drag. For the sake of simplicity certain complicating factors, such as the need to include a special term in the mapping function to generate a corner at the trailing edge, have been suppressed from the present analysis. Also it remains to explore the numerical implementation of the design procedures proposed in this paper.},

The innovative and practically-significant aspects of the proposed method, so-called THINC/LS method, lie in (1) representing the interface with polynomial of arbitrary-order rather than the plane representation commonly used in the Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC) Volume of fluid (VOF) methods, (2) conserving rigorously the mass of the transported VOF field, and (3) providing a straightforward and easy-to-code algorithm for implementation. We verified the proposed scheme with the widely used benchmark tests. Numerical results show that this new method can obtain arbitrary-order accuracy for interface reconstruction and can produce more accurate results than the classical VOF methods.},

The scheme is based on the same elements that make up many modern compressible gas dynamics codes: a high-resolution upwinding based on an approximate Riemann solver for MHD and limited reconstruction; an optimally smoothing multi-stage time-stepping scheme; and solution-adaptive refinement and coarsening. In addition, a method for increasing the accuracy of the scheme by subtracting off an embedded steady magnetic field is presented. Each of the pieces of the scheme is described, and the scheme is validated and its accuracy assessed by comparison with exact solutions. Results are presented for two three-dimensional calculations representative of the interaction of the solar wind with a magenetized planet.},

  volume = {261},
  issn = {0021-9991},
  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to formulate genuinely multidimensional HLL and HLLC Riemann solvers for unstructured meshes by extending our prior papers on the same topic for logically rectangular meshes Balsara (2010, 2012) [4,5]. Such Riemann solvers operate at each vertex of a mesh and accept as an input the set of states that come together at that vertex. The mesh geometry around that vertex is also one of the inputs of the Riemann solver. The outputs are the resolved state and multidimensionally upwinded fluxes in both directions. A formulation which respects the detailed geometry of the unstructured mesh is presented. Closed-form expressions are provided for all the integrals, making it particularly easy to implement the present multidimensional Riemann solvers in existing numerical codes. While it is visually demonstrated for three states coming together at a vertex, our formulation is general enough to treat multiple states (or zones with arbitrary geometry) coming together at a vertex. The present formulation is very useful for two-dimensional and three-dimensional unstructured mesh calculations of conservation laws. It has been demonstrated to work with second to fourth order finite volume schemes on two-dimensional unstructured meshes. On general triangular grids an arbitrary number of states might come together at a vertex of the primal mesh, while for calculations on the dual mesh usually three states come together at a grid vertex. We apply the multidimensional Riemann solvers to hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on unstructured meshes. The Riemann solver is shown to operate well for traditional second order accurate total variation diminishing (TVD) schemes as well as for weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes with ADER (Arbitrary DERivatives in space and time) time-stepping. Several stringent applications for compressible gasdynamics and magnetohydrodynamics are presented, showing that the method performs very well and reaches high order of accuracy in both space and time. The present multidimensional Riemann solver is cost-competitive with traditional, one-dimensional Riemann solvers. It offers the twin advantages of isotropic propagation of flow features and a larger CFL number. Please see http://www.nd.edu/\textasciitilde{}dbalsara/Numerical-PDE-Course for a video introduction to multidimensional Riemann solvers.},

  abstract = {In [10], the authors have designed a new fifth order WENO finite-difference scheme by adding a higher order smoothness indicator which is obtained as a simple and inexpensive linear combination of the already existing low order smoothness indicators. Moreover, this new scheme, dubbed as WENO-Z, has a CPU cost which is equivalent to the one of the classical WENO-JS [2], and smaller than that of the mapped WENO-M, [5], since it involves no mapping of the nonlinear weights. In this article, we take a closer look at Taylor expansions of the Lagrangian polynomials of the WENO substencils and the related inherited symmetries of the classical lower order smoothness indicators to obtain a general formula for the higher order smoothness indicators that allows the extension of the WENO-Z scheme to all (odd) orders of accuracy. We further investigate the improved accuracy of the WENO-Z schemes at critical points of smooth solutions as well as their distinct numerical features as a result of the new sets of nonlinear weights and we show that regarding the numerical dissipation WENO-Z occupies an intermediary position between WENO-JS and WENO-M. Some standard numerical experiments such as the one dimensional Riemann initial values problems for the Euler equations and the Mach 3 shock density-wave interaction and the two dimensional double-Mach shock reflection problems are presented.},

Hence they converge in a nonoscillatory manner to the unique entropy solution. However, monotone methods are at most first order accurate, giving poor accuracy in smooth regions of the flow. Moreover, shocks tend to be heavily smeared and poorly resolved on the grid. These effects are due to the large amount of numerical dissipation in monotone methods. Some dissipation is obviously needed to give nonoscillatory shocks and to ensure that we converge to the vanishing viscosity solution, but monotone methods go overboard in this direction.},

The overall plunging wave breaking process is described with major wave breaking events identified: jet plunge, oblique splash and vertical jet. These major events repeat up to four times before entering the chaotic breaking phase. The plunging wave breaking process of the simulations shows a similar time line as the experiments consisting of startup, steep wave formation, plunging wave, and chaotic wave breaking swept downstream time phases. Wave breaking profile, air entrainment, velocity, vorticity, flume bottom pressure, and energy are analyzed and compared with the experimental results. The simulations qualitatively predict all four time phases, all four plunging events and their sub-events. The wave profile and location at the maximum height is very close to the experiment results. The flume flow and velocity demonstrate the same flow trend as the experiments but with reduced velocity magnitudes. The simulations show similar bottom pressure to the experiments but with large oscillations, and the post-breaking water elevations are larger as compared to the experimental results.},

The incidence of spontaneous resumption of circulation following defibrillation was lowest in animals subjected to metabolic acidosis and hypoxia.

Non-negative reconstruction of Riemann states and compatible discretization of slope source term produce stable and well-balanced solutions to shallow flow hydrodynamics over complex topography. The friction source term is discretized using a splitting implicit scheme. Limiting value of the friction force is derived to ensure stability. This new numerical scheme is validated against four theoretical benchmark tests and then applied to reproduce a laboratory dam break over a domain with irregular bed profile.},

Stokes-type expansions are used to theoretically analyze the linear and nonlinear properties of the models. The coefficients involved in the governing equations are determined from the minimization of the integral error between the linear wave celerity, shoaling gradient, second nonlinear harmonics of the equations and the related analytical solutions. The most promising model is applicable up to kh{$\approx$}25.4 (where kh is the dimensionless water depth, k is the wave number, and h is the water depth) for the dispersive property, to kh{$\approx$}6 for the second nonlinear property within 1\% error, and to kh{$\leq$}6 for the excellent shoaling property. The numerical implementation for one-dimensional governing equations on non-staggered grids is also presented by employing a fourth-order Adams\textendash{}Bashforth\textendash{}Moulton time integration and the high-accuracy finite difference method. Four demanding numerical experiments that require high accuracy of dispersion and nonlinearity are conducted to assess the performance of the models.

  abstract = {We derive a new two-layer Boussinesq model with high accuracy in linear and nonlinear properties and in interior kinematic property from deep to shallow water. This model is formulated in terms of computational horizontal and vertical velocities defined in each layer. The highest derivative in the equations is limited to three, which is convenient for numerical discretization. Stokes-type expansions are used to theoretically analyze the linear and nonlinear properties of the new two-layer Boussinesq model. The dispersive coefficients involved in the governing equations are determined by minimizing the integral error between the linear wave celerity of the Boussinesq model and the analytical solution. Shoaling coefficients are also optimized to expand the application range of the model to the mildly varying bathymetries. The most attractive aspect of this work is that the newly developed two-layer model exhibits high accuracy in linear, nonlinear, shoaling, and kinematic properties from extremely deep to shallow water. The analyses show that the resultant model is applicable to up to kh {$\approx$} 53 in linear dispersion, up to kh {$\approx$} 30 in the second nonlinear property within 1\% error, and up to 0{$<$} kh {$<$} 60 in linear shoaling property with 0.13\% error.

The analysis and numerical methods selected for computer solution are given in some detail. The model uses exact prognostic equations, and a high-order expansion to relate variables at each time step. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated most completely for solitary wave propagation, where model results are compared to exact results. It is found that the model results are much more accurate for high solitary waves than are earlier, Boussinesq-type theories, and give good results for waves so high that they are almost breaking. The capability of the model to treat a variety of situations is demonstrated for colliding solitary waves, nonlinear dispersive wave trains, waves in channels of varying breadth, and undular bores. Formally, the model incorporates nonlinear long wave theory exactly, incorporates enough dispersion to describe linear waves with fourth-order precision, so that both shallow water waves and deep water waves are included, and describes accurately waves for which dispersive and nonlinear effects are both important.},

  abstract = {We propose a comprehensive approach for treating complex wall boundaries in two-phase, free-surface flow simulations on a Cartesian adaptive grid. The external gas\textendash{}liquid interface is handled by the well-known combined level-set volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) method. The new element is the coupling with the wall boundary representation using a second level-set function. The no-slip boundary condition at the walls is enforced by properly populating the ghost cells of a narrow band inside the solid body, using a simple and numerically robust treatment of the contact line. In this framework, merging and separation of multiple solid bodies are easily accommodated. Verification tests with grid convergence analysis are presented for a stationary/oscillating body in single-phase flow and for a drop on an inclined plane. Two examples demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach to study liquid injection. The first is a validation study with data from a scaled-up Diesel injector, to demonstrate how the seamless calculation of internal flow and jet primary atomization can be accomplished. The second is a demonstration of transient atomization response to a measured three-dimensional needle displacement of the injector.},

The closest point transform nds the closest point on a manifold and the Euclidean distance to a manifold for all the points in a grid, (or the grid points within a specied distance of the manifold). We consider manifolds composed of simple geometric shapes, such as, a set of points, piecewise linear curves or triangle meshes. The algorithm computes the closest point on and distance to the manifold by solving the Eikonal equation jruj = 1 by the method of characteristics. The method of characteristics is implemented eciently with the aid of computational geometry and polygon/polyhedron scan conversion. The computed distance is accurate to within machine precision. The computational complexity of the algorithm is linear in both the number of grid points and the complexity of the manifold. Thus it has optimal computational complexity. ...},

The governing equations are reformulated in a conservative form, using high-order finite volume WENO schemes with HLL Riemann solver to handle the flux terms. The efficient third-order Runge\textendash{}Kutta time-stepping scheme is used to advance the numerical solution through time. Wave breaking is predicted by applying a wave breaking criterion to automatically degenerate the Boussinesq equations into nonlinear shallow water equations. In order to test whether the present numerical model could accurately reproduce the processes of transformation, breaking, and run-up of nonlinear dispersive waves under different wave conditions in the nearshore region, five test cases have been simulated. The numerical results show that the present shock-capturing model could simulate the nearshore wave processes very well.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear evolution of wave trains involves amplitude dispersion and four-wave resonant interaction and hence is difficult to describe using a simple wave equation such as the cubic Schr\"odinger equation or conventional Boussinesq equations. The present study develops a set of improved higher-order Boussinesq equations with a wide accuracy range of third-order nonlinear characteristics, including amplitude dispersion, and with superior performance for simulations of the nonlinear evolution of wave trains. The equations are obtained by enhancing the higher-order Boussinesq-type equations developed by Zou [Z.L. Zou, A new form of high-order Boussinesq equations, Ocean Eng. 27 (2000) 557\textendash{}575] through introducing two nonlinear terms into the expression for the computation velocity. The new terms can improve the nonlinear property at higher order by adjusting their free parameters to match the theoretical solutions for amplitude dispersion and the third-order transfer function. Super- and sub-harmonics of bichromatic waves are also improved. The new equations are applied to simulate the nonlinear evolution of wave groups along a 1D wave tank with flat bottom, and nonlinear refraction and diffraction of regular wave trains over a cylindrical ramp, good effectiveness is found.},

Three novel developments are described: (1) a new method for enforcing a volume constraint in which the number of bubbles and drops can change due to merging or splitting, (2) a new, second order, semi-lagrangian narrow band level set reinitialization algorithm, and (3) validation of a two-phase flow numerical method by comparison with linear stability analysis results for a co-flowing liquid jet in gas. The new interface capturing method is tested on benchmark problems in which the velocity is prescribed (passive advection of interfaces) and in which the velocity is determined by the incompressible Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations for two-phase flow. The error in interface position when using the hybrid level set-volume constraint method is reported for many benchmark problems in polar coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, and on an adaptive grid in which one criteria of adaptivity is the magnitude of the interface curvature.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional multiphase flow and flow with phase change are simulated using a simplified method of tracking and reconstructing the phase interface. The new level contour reconstruction technique presented here enables front tracking methods to naturally, automatically, and robustly model the merging and breakup of interfaces in three-dimensional flows. The method is designed so that the phase surface is treated as a collection of physically linked but not logically connected surface elements. Eliminating the need to bookkeep logical connections between neighboring surface elements greatly simplifies the Lagrangian tracking of interfaces, particularly for 3D flows exhibiting topology change. The motivation for this new method is the modeling of complex three-dimensional boiling flows where repeated merging and breakup are inherent features of the interface dynamics. Results of 3D film boiling simulations with multiple interacting bubbles are presented. The capabilities of the new interface reconstruction method are also tested in a variety of two-phase flows without phase change. Three-dimensional simulations of bubble merging and droplet collision, coalescence, and breakup demonstrate the new method's ability to easily handle topology change by film rupture or filamentary breakup. Validation tests are conducted for drop oscillation and bubble rise. The susceptibility of the numerical method to parasitic currents is also thoroughly assessed.},

The resulting algorithm, which is based on Lagrangian tracking using meshless particles with Eulerian reference grid, can naturally handle/control topological changes. Moreover, adaptive sampling of the interface can be achieved easily through local grid refinement with simple quad/oct-tree data structure.

  shorttitle = {Handling Solid\textendash{}Fluid Interfaces for Viscous Flows},
  abstract = {The ghost cell approaches (GCA) for handling stationary solid boundaries, regular or irregular, are first investigated theoretically and numerically for the diffusion equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The main conclusion of this part of investigation is that the approximation for the diffusion term has to be second-order accurate everywhere in order for the numerical solution to be rigorously second-order accurate. Violating this principle, the linear and quadratic GCAs have the following shortcomings: (1) restrictive constraints on grid size when the viscosity is small; (2) susceptibleness to instability of a time-explicit formulation for strongly transient flows; (3) convergence deterioration to zeroth- or first-order for solutions with high-frequency modes. Therefore, the widely-used linear extrapolation for enforcing no-slip boundary conditions should be avoided, even for regular solid boundaries. As a remedy, a simple method based on explicit jump approximation (EJA) is proposed. EJA hinges on the idea that a velocity-derivative jump at the boundary reduces to the value of the velocity-derivative at the fluid side because the velocity of the stationary boundary is zero. Although the time-marching linear system of EJA is not symmetric, it is strictly diagonal dominant with positive diagonal entries. Numerical results show that, over a large range of viscosity and grid sizes, EJA performs much better than GCAs in terms of stability and accuracy. Furthermore, the second-order convergence of EJA does not depend on viscosity and the spectrum of the solution, as those of GCAs do. This paper is written with enough details so that one can reproduce the numerical results.},

  abstract = {A general approach is given to extend WENO reconstructions to a class of numerical schemes that use different types of moments (i.e., multi-moments) simultaneously as the computational variables, such as point values and grid cell averages. The key is to re-map the multi-moment values to single moment values (e.g., cell average or point values), which can then be used to invoke known, standard reconstruction coefficients and smoothness indicators for single moment WENO reconstructions. The WENO reconstructions in turn provide the numerical approximations for the flux functions and other required quantities. One major advantage of using multi-moments for WENO reconstructions is its compactness. We present two new multi-moment WENO (MM-WENO) schemes of fifth order that use reconstructions supported over only three grid cells, as opposed to the usual five. This is similar to the Hermite WENO schemes of Qiu and Shu (J Comput Phys 193:115\textendash{}135, 2003), which can also be derived using our general approach. Numerical tests demonstrate that the new schemes achieve their designed fifth order accuracy and eliminate spurious oscillations effectively. The numerical solutions to all benchmark tests are of good quality and comparable to the classic, single moment WENO scheme of the same order of accuracy. The basic idea presented in this paper is universal, which makes the WENO reconstruction an easy-to-follow method for developing a wide variety of additional multi-moment numerical schemes.},

  abstract = {A robust two-phase flow Large Eddy Simulation (LES) algorithm has been developed and applied to predict the primary breakup of an axisymmetric water jet injected into a surrounding coaxial air flow. The high liquid/gas density and viscosity ratios are known to represent a significant challenge in numerical modelling of the primary breakup process. In the current LES methodology, an extrapolated liquid velocity field was used to minimise discretisation errors, whilst maintaining sharp treatment of fluid properties across the interface. The proposed numerical approach showed excellent robustness and high accuracy in predicting coaxial liquid jet primary breakup. Since strong turbulence structures will develop inside the injector at high Reynolds numbers and affect the subsequent primary breakup, the Rescaling and Recycling Method (R2M) was implemented to facilitate generation of appropriate unsteady LES inlet conditions for both phases. The influence of inflowing liquid and gas turbulent structures on the initial interface instability was investigated. It is shown that liquid turbulent eddies play the dominant role in the initial development of liquid jet surface disturbance and distortion for the flow conditions considered. When turbulent inflows were specified by the R2M technique, the predicted core breakup lengths at different air/water velocities agreed closely with experimental data.},

  abstract = {An interface capturing method with a continuous function is proposed within the framework of the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. Being different from the traditional VOF methods that require a geometrical reconstruction and identify the interface by a discontinuous Heaviside function, the present method makes use of the hyperbolic tangent function (known as one of the sigmoid type functions) in the tangent of hyperbola interface capturing (THINC) method [F. Xiao, Y. Honma, K. Kono, A simple algebraic interface capturing scheme using hyperbolic tangent function, Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids 48 (2005) 1023\textendash{}1040] to retrieve the interface in an algebraic way from the volume-fraction data of multi-component materials. Instead of the 1D reconstruction in the original THINC method, a multi-dimensional hyperbolic tangent function is employed in the present new approach. The present scheme resolves moving interface with geometric faithfulness and compact thickness, and has at least the following advantages: (1) the geometric reconstruction is not required in constructing piecewise approximate functions; (2) besides a piecewise linear interface, curved (quadratic) surface can be easily constructed as well; and (3) the continuous multi-dimensional hyperbolic tangent function allows the direct calculations of derivatives and normal vectors. Numerical benchmark tests including transport of moving interface and incompressible interfacial flows are presented to validate the numerical accuracy for interface capturing and to show the capability for practical problems such as a stationary circular droplet, a drop oscillation, a shear-induced drop deformation and a rising bubble.},

  issn = {0027-0644},
  abstract = {A numerical model for shallow-water equations has been built and tested on the Yin\textendash{}Yang overset spherical grid. A high-order multimoment finite-volume method is used for the spatial discretization in which two kinds of so-called moments of the physical field [i.e., the volume integrated average (VIA) and the point value (PV)] are treated as the model variables and updated separately in time. In the present model, the PV is computed by the semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian formulation, whereas the VIA is predicted in time via a flux-based finite-volume method and is numerically conserved on each component grid. The concept of including an extra moment (i.e., the volume-integrated value) to enforce the numerical conservativeness provides a general methodology and applies to the existing semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian formulations. Based on both VIA and PV, the high-order interpolation reconstruction can only be done over a single grid cell, which then minimizes the overlapping zone between the Yin and Yang components and effectively reduces the numerical errors introduced in the interpolation required to communicate the data between the two components. The present model completely gets around the singularity and grid convergence in the polar regions of the conventional longitude\textendash{}latitude grid. Being an issue demanding further investigation, the high-order interpolation across the overlapping region of the Yin\textendash{}Yang grid in the current model does not rigorously guarantee the numerical conservativeness. Nevertheless, these numerical tests show that the global conservation error in the present model is negligibly small. The model has competitive accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract = {A global numerical model for shallow water flows on the cubed-sphere grid is proposed in this paper. The model is constructed by using the constrained interpolation profile/multi-moment finite volume method (CIP/MM FVM). Two kinds of moments, i.e. the point value (PV) and the volume-integrated average (VIA) are defined and independently updated in the present model by different numerical formulations. The Lax\textendash{}Friedrichs upwind splitting is used to update the PV moment in terms of a derivative Riemann problem, and a finite volume formulation derived by integrating the governing equations over each mesh element is used to predict the VIA moment. The cubed-sphere grid is applied to get around the polar singularity and to obtain uniform grid spacing for a spherical geometry. Highly localized reconstruction in CIP/MM FVM is well suited for the cubed-sphere grid, especially in dealing with the discontinuity in the coordinates between different patches. The mass conservation is completely achieved over the whole globe. The numerical model has been verified by Williamson's standard test set for shallow water equation model on sphere. The results reveal that the present model is competitive to most existing ones.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present two practical schemes for advection transport equation. The schemes, namely Conservative Semi-Lagrangian with Rational function (CSLR0) and CSLR1, are two new variants of the Constrained Interpolation Profile-Conservative Semi-Lagrangian (CIP-CSL) type methods [Yabe et al., 2001]. In these schemes, the subgrid profile is approximated within a single cell by rational interpolation functions. Both the cell-integrated average and the values at the two cell interfaces are employed for the interpolation construction. The interface value is computed through a semi-Lagrangian procedure, while the cell-integrated quantity is advanced via a flux form formulation that is equivalent to a mass conservative remapping. The schemes are exactly conservative with regards to the cell integration of the advected quantity and have quite small dispersion and diffusion errors. The rational interpolations suppress spurious oscillation, and a continuous profile with a smoothness of at least C0 can be obtained over the whole computational domain. Without any explicit computation of flux or slope limiter, the schemes are more computationally efficient than the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) scheme in the context of 1D. Our numerical tests show that the presented schemes are comparable to the PPM method with regards to numerical dispersion, clipping, and shape preserving.},

  abstract = {Two semi-Lagrangian schemes that guarantee exactly mass conservation are proposed. Although they are in a nonconservative form, the interpolation functions are constructed under the constraint of conservation of cell-integrated value (mass) that is advanced by remapping the Lagrangian volume. Consequently, the resulting schemes conserve the mass for each computational grid cell. One of them (CIP\textendash{}CSL4) is the direct extension of the original cubic-interpolated propagation (CIP) method in which a cubic polynomial is used as the interpolation function and the gradient is calculated according to the differentiated advection equation. A fourth-order polynomial is employed as the interpolation function in the CIP\textendash{}CSL4 method and mass conservation is incorporated as an additional constraint on the reconstruction of the interpolation profile. In another scheme (CIP\textendash{}CSL2), the CIP principle is applied to integrated mass and the interpolation function becomes quadratic. The latter one can be readily extended to multidimensions. Besides the linear advection transportation equation, these schemes are also applied to the nonlinear advection problem with a large Courant\textendash{}Freidrichs\textendash{}Lewy number.},

  abstract = {A 3D numerical model for computing large rigid objects suspended in fluid flow has been developed. Rather than calculating the surface pressure upon the solid body, we evaluate the net force and torque based on a volume force formulation. The total effective force is obtained by summing up the forces at the Eulerian grids occupied by the rigid body. The effects of the moving bodies are coupled to the fluid flow by imposing the velocity field of the bodies to the fluid. A Poisson equation is used to compute the pressure over the whole domain. The objects are identified by color functions and calculated by the PPM scheme and a tangent function transformation which scales the transition region of the computed interface to a compact thickness. The model is then implemented on a parallel computer of distributed memory and validated with Stokes and low Reynolds number flows.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a second-order projection method for the time-dependent, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. As in the original projection method developed by Chorin, we first solve diffusion-convection equations to predict intermediate velocities which are then projected onto the space of divergence-free vector fields. By introducing more coupling between the diffusion-convection step and the projection step we obtain a temporal discretization that is second-order accurate. Our treatment of the diffusion-convection step uses a specialized higher order Godunov method for differencing the nonlinear convective terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms at high Reynolds number. The Godunov procedure is second-order accurate for smooth flow and remains stable for discontinuous initial data, even in the zero-viscosity limit. We approximate the projection directly using a Galerkin procedure that uses a local basis for discretely divergence-free vector fields. Numerical results are presented validating the convergence properties of the method. We also apply the method to doubly periodic shear-layers to assess the performance of the method on more difficult applications.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to explore concepts for active control of turbulent boundary layers leading to skin-friction reduction using the direct numerical simulation technique. Significant drag reduction is achieved when the surface boundary condition is modified to suppress the dynamically significant coherent structures present in the wall region. The drag reduction is accompanied by significant reduction in the intensity of the wall-layer structures and reductions in the magnitude of Reynolds shear stress throughout the flow. The apparent outward shift of turbulence statistics in the controlled flows indicates a displaced virtual origin of the boundary layer and a thickened sublayer. Time sequences of the flow fields show that there are essentially two drag-reduction mechanisms. Firstly, within a short time after the control is applied, drag is reduced mainly by deterring the sweep motion without modifying the primary streamwise vortices above the wall. Consequently, the high-shear-rate regions on the wall are moved to the interior of the channel by the control schemes. Secondly, the active control changes the evolution of the wall vorticity layer by stabilizing and preventing lifting of the spanwise vorticity near the wall, which may suppress a source of new streamwise vortices above the wall.},

The method is based on a fractional-step, or time-splitting, scheme in conjunction with the approximate-factorization technique. It is shown that the use of velocity boundary conditions for the intermediate velocity field can lead to inconsistent numerical solutions. Appropriate boundary conditions for the intermediate velocity field are derived and tested. Numerical solutions for flows inside a driven cavity and over a backward-facing step are presented and compared with experimental data and other numerical results.},

The resulting discretization approach, which is a type of the CIP/multi-moment finite volume method and called VSIAM3 (volume/surface integrated average-based multi-moment method), is combined with a pressure-based projection formulation for the time integration to enable the simulations for both compressible and incompressible flows. The numerical algorithm for multi-dimensions will be reported in this paper. Numerical experiments with flows of a wide range Mach numbers will be also presented.},

The key to this method is a semi-Lagrangian conservative scheme, namely CIP\_CSL3, recently proposed by the author. In the CIP\_CSL3 scheme, the first-order derivative of the interpolation polynomial at each cell centre is used to control the shape of the reconstructed profile. We show in the present paper that the first-order derivative, which plays a crucial role in reconstructing the interpolation profile, can also be used to eliminate numerical diffusion. The resulting algorithm can be directly used to compute the VOF-like function and retain the compact thickness of the moving interface in multi-fluid simulations. No surface reconstruction based on the value of VOF function is required in the method, which makes it quite economical and easy to use. The presented method has been tested with various interfacial flows including pure rotation, vortex shearing, multi-vortex deformation and the moving boundaries in real fluid as well. The method gives promising results to all computed problems. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This description is made possible by the CIP method combined with variable transformation. This scheme can be used for detecting sharp boundary of compressible fluid as well as incompressible fluid. Lower order schemes with the same procedure cannot reproduce the result. This scheme is applied to the injection of heavier fluid into lighter fluid and the roll-up of mushroom structure is successfully treated by the density function. The interaction of a shock wave with a liquid drop is an interesting but quite difficult test problem. Even in this case, the liquid mass is conserved within an error of 0.15\%.},

  abstract = {A method of treating a sharp discontinuity with a density function is proposed. The surface of the density function is captured within a grid cell throughout the calculation even when the discontinuity surface is largely distorted. This description is made possible by the CIP (cubic-interpolated propagation) method combined with variable transformation. This scheme can be used for detecting a sharp boundary in compressible fluid as well as incompressible fluid. Lower order schemes with the same procedure cannot reproduce the result. This scheme is applied to the interaction of a shock wave with a liquid drop. The liquid mass is conserved within an error of 0.15\%.},

  issn = {1097-0363},
  abstract = {This paper presents a simple and practical scheme for capturing moving interfaces or free boundaries in multi-fluid simulations. The scheme, which is called THINC (tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing), makes use of the hyperbolic tangent function to compute the numerical flux for the fluid fraction function, and gives a conservative, oscillation-less and smearing-less solution to the fluid fraction function even for the extremely distorted interfaces of arbitrary complexity. The numerical results from the THINC scheme possess adequate quality for practical applications, which make the extra geometric reconstruction, such as those in most of the volume of fluid (VOF) methods unnecessary. Thus the scheme is quite simple. The numerical tests show that the THINC scheme has competitive accuracy compared to most exiting methods. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
